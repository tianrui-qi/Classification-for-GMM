## Abstract

To enrich the diversity of artificial neurons, a type of quadratic neurons was proposed previously, where the inner product of inputs and weights is replaced by a quadratic operation. In this paper, we demonstrate the superiority of such quadratic neurons over conventional counterparts. For this purpose, we train such quadratic neural networks using an adapted backpropagation algorithm and perform a systematic comparison between quadratic and conventional neural networks for classificaiton of Gaussian mixture data, which is one of the most important machine learning tasks. Our results show that quadratic neural networks enjoy remarkably better efficacy and efficiency than conventional neural networks in this context, and potentially extendable to other relevant applications.
